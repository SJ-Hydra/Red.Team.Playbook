# Red Team Testing Notes, Files Repository

These are my notes for Red Team engagements. There are likely to be items not disclosed in this repository so experience will dictate your engagment. Be sure to carry out the kick-off discussion using the attached questionaire (Kick_off_Call.txt) prior to commencing the test. Always have written permission from the system owner(s) before conducting penetration tests.
